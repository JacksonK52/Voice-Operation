## What is voice operation all about?

   Wound it be nice to write a piece of code and make your computer 
say “Good Morning, Afternoon or Evening”(according to your computer time) 
when you turn on your computer, well our project is all about that. Our 
project aim is to create a simple and easy to use code so that any user who 
want to make their device talk for their upcoming mega project or to make a 
simple program that say “welcome” just by saving the code that they want 
as simple as that. 
   Our project is completely an open-source project so that any user 
can tweak any code that he/she wants.


## Why VB Script?
   Well we want to make our code work right out of the box without installing 
 an additional program or software for it that's why we went for vbs and it is also easy to code on vbs.
