# Voice-Operation
 	Please go through this file first so that we all can understand the project and work on achieving the same goal of this project.
	
# What is voice operation all about?
	Wound it be nice to write a piece of code and make your computer say “Good Morning, Afternoon or Evening” according to your computer time when you turn on your computer, well our project is all about that. Our project aim is to create a simple and easy to use code so that any user who want to make their device talk for their upcoming mega project or to make a simple program that says “welcome” just by saving the code that they want as simple as that. 
	We are currently using vbsript (Visual Basic Script) but if you have some good scripting or programming languages in mind then feel free to share.
	Our project is completely an open-source project so that any user can tweak any code that he/she wants. We advise you not to upload any code that you don’t want to share with the rest of the world. 

# Why VB Script and why not other?
	Well we want to make our code work right out of the box without installing an additional program or software for it so we went for vbs but we are also planning to work on other scripting/programming languages as our project grows.

# How can user help
	
Thank you for taking your time to look into this project and hope you will also takes part in our future projects.
