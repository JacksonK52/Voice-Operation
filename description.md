## What is voice operation all about?

   Wound it be nice to write a piece of code and make your computer 
say “Good Morning, Afternoon or Evening”(according to your computer time) 
when you turn on your computer, well our project is all about that. Our 
project aim is to create a simple and easy to use code so that any user who 
want to make their device talk for their upcoming mega project or to make a 
simple program that says “welcome” just by saving the code that they want 
as simple as that. 
   We are currently using vbsript (Visual Basic Script) but if you 
have some good scripting or programming languages in mind then feel free to 
share.
   Our project is completely an open-source project so that any user 
can tweak any code that he/she wants. We advise you not to upload(push) any 
code that you don’t want to share with the rest of the world. 


## Why VB Script and why not other?
   Well we want to make our code work right out of the box without installing 
 an additional program or software for it so we went for vbs but we are also 
 planning to work on other scripting/programming languages as our project grows.
